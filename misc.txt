Need to set the path in the sonar (i.e. localhost or server or cloud) administration for scala to "target/scoverage.xml"

From SonarQube dashboard click Administration -> Languages and select Scala.

To run maven with a different Java version just use the command below but replace the specific java path.
   JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64 mvn
